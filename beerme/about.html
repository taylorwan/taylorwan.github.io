				<p>College students sometimes tend to be oblivious to their alcohol consumption in social scenes. Although some are mindful of their drinking limits, others are lacking that awareness and understanding of alcohol's health consequences. BeerMe is an Alcohol Awareness Application. There are three parts; the first is a calculation of the user's alcohol tolerance. The second is a demonstration of the user's health report according to the alcohol choices they made earlier. The third is an examination of what the user has learned, in this part, the user is tested on what they learned from the application through a series of different questions.</p>

				<p>The application asks the user for information about their name, gender, weight and number of hours they are planning to drink for. It then allows the user to choose different alcoholic drinks of varying percentages.</p>

					Social Good Perspective
				</div>


				<p>Drinking has become a popular social act not only among adults but among underage students as well. College students often consume more alcohol than their body can tolerate and thus can sometimes cause some major health issues. Beer Me is an application that educates students on the importance of alcohol intake moderation. This is achieved through calculating the user's alcohol tolerance and then extending it to an interactive personalized "How Many Does It Take" page that allows the user to choose a number of different drinks. The user is then directed to a personalized Health Report that illustrates the health effects of the alcohol combination they chose on their body now and in the long run as well.</p>

				<p>As a result, this application makes drinkers aware of their tolerance, health risks of alcohol and examines their knowledge at the end. Finally, this leaves us with a well-informed and safe drinker.</p>
