				<p>College students sometimes tend to be oblivious to their alcohol consumption in social scenes. Although some are mindful of their drinking limits, others are lacking that awareness and understanding of alcohol's health consequences. BeerMe is an Alcohol Awareness Application. There are three parts; the first is a calculation of the user's alcohol tolerance. The second is a demonstration of the user's health report according to the alcohol choices they made earlier. The third is an examination of what the user has learned, in this part, the user is tested on what they learned from the application through a series of different questions.</p>

				<p>The application asks the user for information about their name, gender, weight and number of hours they are planning to drink for. It then allows the user to choose different alcoholic drinks of varying percentages.</p>
