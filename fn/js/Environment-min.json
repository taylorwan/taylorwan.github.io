The act authorizes the state board to order consolidation with a receiving water system where a public water system, or a state small water system within a disadvantaged community, consistently fails to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water. The act authorizes the state board to order the extension of service to an area that does not have access to an adequate supply of safe drinking water so long as the extension of service is an interim extension of service in preparation for consolidation. Existing law, for these purposes, defines \"disadvantaged community\" to mean a disadvantaged community that is in an unincorporated area or is served by a mutual water company.\n\nThis bill would make a community disadvantaged for these purposes if the community is in a mobilehome park even if it is not in an unincorporated area or served by a mutual water company. The bill would limit the authority of the state board to order consolidation or extension of service to provide that authority only with regard to a disadvantaged community.\n\nThe act requires the state board, before ordering consolidation or extension of service, to hold at least one initial public meeting, as specified, and to obtain written consent from any domestic well owner for consolidation or extension of service. The act provides that any affected resident within the consolidation or extended service area who does not provide written consent is ineligible, until consent is provided, for any future water-related grant funding from the state, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would provide that an initial public meeting is not required for a potentially subsumed area that is served only by domestic wells. The bill would apply to the domestic well owner, instead of to an affected resident, within the consolidation or extended service area the written consent requirement for eligibility for water-related grant funding.\n\nThe act requires the state board, upon ordering the consolidation or extension of service, to adequately compensate the owners of a privately owned subsumed water system for the fair market value of the system as determined by the Public Utilities Commission for water corporations subject to the commission's jurisdiction or the state board for all other systems. The act prohibits a consolidated water system from increasing charges on existing customers of the receiving water system solely as a consequence of the consolidation or extension of service unless the customer receives a corresponding benefit.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize the Public Utilities Commission or the state board to determine the fair market value of a subsumed water system, without regard to whether the system is a water corporation subject to the commission's jurisdiction. The bill would prohibit fees or charges imposed on a customer of a subsumed water system from exceeding the cost of consolidating the water system or the cost of extension of service to the area.\n\nThe act exempts the consolidation or extension of service pursuant to these provisions from the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000, which governs the procedures for the formation and change of organization of cities and special districts.\n\nThis bill would instead exempt an action taken by the state board pursuant to these provisions from the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000.\n\nThis bill would authorize the state board, for the purpose of providing affordable, safe drinking water to disadvantaged communities and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse, to contract with an administrator to provide administrative and managerial services to a designated water system and to order the designated public water system to accept those services. The bill would define designated water system as a public water system that serves a disadvantaged community and that the state board finds consistently fails to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water. The bill would require the state board to provide a public water system with notice, as specified, before determining that the public water system is a designated public water system. The bill would authorize the administrator of a designated public water system to expend available moneys for capital infrastructure improvements that the designated public water system needs to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water, to set and collect user water rates and fees, and to expend available moneys for the operation and maintenance costs of the designated public water system.", "last_action": "2016-05-27 00:00:00", "locality": "ca", "title": "Public water systems: disadvantaged communities: consolidation or extension of service: administrative and managerial services.", "external_id": "SB 552", "id": 1492314}, {"status": "introduced", "sharable_bill_page": "https://app.fiscalnote.com/#/share/bill?url=f1fe749ebf0a3bdf1bf1e2ea0e7b6528", "floor": "89.4", "prefloor": "4.070645129671556", "description": "(1) Existing law establishes the Air Quality Improvement Program that is administered by the State Air Resources Board for the purposes of funding projects related to, among other things, reduction of criteria air pollutants and improvement of air quality.

That law defines the terms \"gross receipts\" and \"sales price.\"\n\nThis bill, on and after January 1, 2017, would exclude from \"gross receipts\" and \"sales price\" that portion of the cost of a new or used near-zero or zero-emission vehicle purchased by a low-income purchaser, as defined, that does not exceed $40,000.\n\nThe Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes generally in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws.\n\nThis bill would specify that this exemption does not apply to local sales and use taxes or transactions and use taxes. \n\n(3) The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law. \n\nThis bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, allow a credit under the Personal Income Tax Law in an amount equal to $2,500 to a qualified taxpayer, as defined, who purchased a near-zero or zero-emission vehicle during the taxable year. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to provide that the credit amount in excess of tax liability would be refundable in those years in which an appropriation for that purpose is made by the Legislature. \n\nThe Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows various deductions from gross income in computing adjusted gross income under that law, including deductions for payments to individual retirement accounts, alimony payments, and interest on educational loans.\n\nThis bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, would allow a deduction of $2,500 in computing adjusted gross income to a qualified taxpayer, as defined, who purchased a near-zero or zero-emission vehicle during the taxable year, as provided. \n\nThis bill would require a qualified taxpayer to make an irrevocable election to either claim the above-described deduction or credit for the taxable year.\n\n(4) This bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to make an annual report to the Legislature regarding the tax provisions allowed by the bill.", "last_action": "2016-05-27 00:00:00", "locality": "ca", "title": "Vehicular air pollution: zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicles.", "external_id": "AB 1710", "id": 1665846}, {"status": "introduced", "sharable_bill_page": "https://app.fiscalnote.com/#/share/bill?url=d52d3651a845a6b3b7609c047e7c3a52", "floor": "97.5", "prefloor": "4.1117374754946534", "description": "Existing law requires various state agencies to administer programs relating to water supply, water quality, and flood management in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.\n\nThe bill would prohibit the construction of a peripheral canal, as defined, unless expressly authorized by an initiative voted on by the voters of California on or after January 1, 2017, and would require the Legislative Analyst's Office to complete a prescribed economic feasibility analysis prior to a vote authorizing the construction of a peripheral canal.", "last_action": "2016-05-27 00:00:00", "locality": "ca", "title": "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta: peripheral canal.", "external_id": "AB 1713", "id": 1665849}, {"status": "introduced", "sharable_bill_page": "https://app.fiscalnote.com/#/share/bill?url=f5794aabecb75647ce95785c5d121d62", "floor": "88.525", "prefloor": "4.294549246523883", "description": "Existing law requires applicants for appropriation of water for small domestic, small irrigation, or livestock stockpond use to register with the State Water Resources Control Board, as specified.
